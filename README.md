# Diabetes-Prediction-
I have build a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning.  In this project, I have used Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
The dataset used is this project is  PIMA  diabetes dataset downloaded form kaggle.
The accuracy score of the training data is : 79% approx
and the  accuracy score of the test data is : 77% approx
